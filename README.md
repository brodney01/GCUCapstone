# DSC-590-O500 Capstone: Analysis of Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

**Project background**

The purpose of this project is to perform statistical and exploratory analysis on recent marketing campaign data to identify the levels of effectiveness. The goal is to analyze the dataset to understand the effectiveness of global marketing campaigns and propose recommendations that will improve future operations.

**Implementation approach**

The project being undertaken is to illustrate how, with the appropriate statistical analysis, marketing campaigns may be assessed for performance, and replicated to ensure continued success of an organizations marketing strategy. However, once the analysis is completed, a data product solution is required to showcase the results to both stakeholders and agents, so they may understand the underlying themes without being bogged down in technical reviews. Without a way to illustrate the results of success campaigns and drive change, an organization would be lost on what was working and what wasnâ€™t, consequently effecting the consumer downstream that is being marketed materials that are not relevant. This is where a dashboard data product would benefit an organization best; allowing commercial leadership to visualize their key results without the need of a multi-page report.
